    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK that lets you easily combine AI services like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Hugging Face with conventional programming languages like C# and Python. By doing so, you can create AI apps that combine the best of both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Copilot Stack](./imgs/mind-and-body-of-semantic-kernel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel has been engineered to allow developers to flexibly integrate AI services into their existing apps. To do so, Semantic Kernel provides a set of connectors that make it easy to add memories and models. In this way, Semantic Kernel is able to add a simulated \"brain\" to your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Semantic Kernel makes it easy to add skills to your applications with AI plugins that allow you to interact with the real world. These plugins are composed of prompts and native functions that can respond to triggers and perform actions. In this way, plugins are like the \"body\" of your AI app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the extensibility Semantic Kernel provides with connectors and plugins, you can use it to orchestrate AI plugins from both OpenAI and Microsoft on top of nearly any model. For example, you can use Semantic Kernel to orchestrate plugins built for ChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365 Copilot on top of models from OpenAI, Azure, or even Hugging Face.\n",

Embeddings make it easier to do machine learning on large inputs like sparse vectors representing words. Ideally, an embedding captures some of the semantics of the input by placing semantically similar inputs close together in the embedding space. An embedding can be learned and reused across models."
